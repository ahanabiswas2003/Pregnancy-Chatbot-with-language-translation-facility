Pregnancy Overview,"Pregnancy typically lasts about 40 weeks, starting from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP) to the birth of the baby."
Trimester 1 (Weeks 1-12),"In the first trimester, the fetus undergoes rapid development. This is when most of the baby's major organs form. Pregnant women should start taking prenatal vitamins, especially folic acid, to support neural development."
Trimester 2 (Weeks 13-26),"In the second trimester, the baby's organs and systems continue to develop. Expectant mothers should focus on calcium and vitamin D for strong bones and teeth, as well as iron to support increased blood volume."
Trimester 3 (Weeks 27-40),"In the third trimester, the baby gains most of its weight. Foods rich in protein, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids are essential to support the baby's brain growth and prevent constipation."
Folic Acid,"Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects and is crucial in the early stages of pregnancy. Pregnant women need 400-800 mcg per day, typically found in leafy greens, citrus fruits, and fortified cereals."
Iron,"Iron supports the production of hemoglobin, which is important for the increased blood volume in pregnancy. Good sources include lean meat, beans, spinach, and iron-fortified foods."
Calcium,"Calcium supports the baby's bone development. Pregnant women should aim for 1,000 mg of calcium per day from sources such as dairy products, fortified plant-based milk, and leafy greens."
Prenatal Care,"Regular prenatal checkups are important to monitor both the mother's and baby's health. Common tests include blood pressure checks, ultrasounds, and glucose screening for gestational diabetes."
Exercise During Pregnancy,"Moderate exercise, such as walking, swimming, or prenatal yoga, is beneficial for most pregnant women, as long as it's approved by their healthcare provider."
Hydration,"Staying hydrated during pregnancy is crucial. Pregnant women should aim for about 8-10 cups of water per day to support amniotic fluid levels and overall health."
Foods to Avoid,"Pregnant women should avoid raw or undercooked meats, unpasteurized dairy products, and certain types of fish like swordfish and shark due to the risk of mercury."
